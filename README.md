## Introduction
In May 2024 - July 2024 .I joined the THAILAND ABU ROBOCON CHAMPIONSHIP 2024 ,My Team is GOOSE RIDER Team . This event is supposed by TRCC ([Thonburi Robot Contest Club](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063509441154)) . For all the problems, we can get through it with determination, and we are committed to doing this as best as we can. My Work is Designed an electronics and communication system between ESP32 and Arduino Mega2560 using the I2C interface for seamless data exchange and integration, And analyzed Omnidirectional Robotics Drive System. 

This team has shaped me into a good player, so I can make the most of the resources I have to create the best system.
